# Webflow Form

Setup your form to send some request and control the success and failing flow.

## Usage

Configure your form id, action and method. E.g.:

<img src="form-settings-sample.png" alt="Form settings sample"></img>

**IMPORTANT**: Set your form name in lowercase, without accents or special characters and with words separated by `-`.
- Bad: `@my form`, `Fomul√°rio de contato`.
- Good: `contact-form`, `newsletter`, `ebook-request`.


Continuing... embed the package script in your webflow project and call the function `setUpWebflowForm` passing your form name (The same defined on form settings above). E.g.:

```html
<script onload="setUpWebflowForm('contact-form')" src="https://unpkg.com/@smartins/webflow-form"></script>
```

When the form was submitted a request will be sent to URL defined on `action` with `method` (POST, by default) and form data obtained from inputs inside your `form` element.
